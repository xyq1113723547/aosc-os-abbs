<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="which-version-shall-i-be-using">Which version shall I be using?</h3>
<p>Always use the <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Versions">latest released version</a> ### Should I use the version shipped with my Linux distribution? Emphatically <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Distribution-Packages">NO</a> ### Which versions are supported? Which ones are compatible with which versions? On which platforms? See <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Versions">versions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Platforms">platforms</a> ### Why do I get a GPG signature warning when I try to install You probably forgot to import the GPG key before installing the package.<br />
The key signature is: <code>c11c 0a4d f702 edf6 c04f 458c 18ad b31c f18a d6bb</code>. ### I get a GPG error: <code>KEYEXPIRED 1273837137</code> The key had expired. Try re-importing the <a href="https://xpra.org/gpg.asc">updated key</a>.<br />
On Debian you may have to delete the key (<code>apt-key -d</code>) before adding it again. ### Debian’s APT says <em>Origin changed</em>, <em>this must be accepted explicitly…</em> when updating Run <code>apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change</code>. ### Debian’s Aptitude says <em>Some index files failed to download</em> when updating See above.</p>

<h2 id="usage-questions">Usage questions</h2>
<h3 id="where-is-xpras-system-tray-icon">Where is xpra’s system tray icon?</h3>
<p>Some desktop environments <a href="./Features/System-Tray.html#caveats">make it impossible to show a system tray icon</a>. ### Why does Xpra use any CPU when the session is idle? <a href="./Features/Audio.html">Audio forwarding</a> will consume a fairly constant amount of CPU and bandwidth. Turn speaker forwarding off if you don’t need it.<br />
Some applications will also repaint their windows unnecessarily. If you don’t use them, try minimizing their windows. ### Why does the clipboard keep flashing? Why is clipboard synchronization unreliable? Make sure that no other tool is also doing clipboard synchronization. Avoid clipboard managers at all cost. ### I use <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/issues/696">RDP #696</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/issues/735">x2go #735</a> and I have clipboard or other problems These tools will do their own clipboard synchronization which will definitely interfere with xpra’s.<br />
Try disabling one of the clipboard synchronization mechanisms, and if possible, do not layer remote desktop protocols on top of each other. ### Where is the command output when I use <code>Xpra.exe</code>? <code>Xpra.exe</code> is a graphical application, the command output will go to a <code>Xpra.log</code> file found in <code>%APPDATA%\Xpra</code>.<br />
Use <code>Xpra_cmd.exe</code> instead. ### How can I start <code>gpg-agent</code>, <code>dbus</code>, etc for each session? The solution is often distribution specific.<br />
You may want to add <code>--start=/path/to/Xsession</code> to your server options.<br />
Or you may want to add each application individually using a <code>start</code> option for each application.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<h3 id="some-gnome-applications-take-a-long-time-to-start-ie-gnome-terminal">Some gnome applications take a long time to start (ie: <code>gnome-terminal</code>)</h3>
<p>Try adding <code>--source-start=gnome-keyring-daemon</code> to your server. (see <a href="https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/issues/3109">gnome-terminal takes too long to launch</a>, not supported with older versions so use <code>--start=gnome-keyring-daemon</code> instead) ### My xpra seamless or desktop session has crashed! Can I recover it? Generally yes, as long as the virtual display server (vfb) has not crashed.<br />
If the xpra server is completely gone, you can start a new one to re-use the existing display.<br />
If the xpra server is still running but unresponsive, you should kill it first (and use <code>kill -9</code> to prevent the tear down code from also stopping the vfb display) ### Application X creates a new tab or window on an existing display, not the display I want to use If the application does not provide an option to prevent this behaviour, you may need to use a different user account to launch multiple instances of this application on different displays - this is a common issue with some applications, in particular browsers ### Why are my applications missing their menu bar on Ubuntu? Always start your applications with <code>xpra start --start=APP</code> and not <code>DISPLAY=:N APP</code> (see #1419)</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-allow-multiple-users-to-connect-through-a-single-port">How can I allow multiple users to connect through a single port?</h3>
<p>Use the <a href="./Usage/Proxy-Server.html">proxy server</a>. ### How can I use an SSH key with MS Windows clients? If your SSH key is not detected and used correctly by default, you may want to use <code>pageant</code>: <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html#faq-options">putty FAQ: How do I use public keys</a> and tell xpra to use putty: <code>--ssh=plink</code>.</p>

<h2 id="warnings-and-messages">Warnings and Messages</h2>
<h3 id="cannot-create-group-socket-runxprausername-usually-followed-by-errno-13-permission-denied">“<code>cannot create group socket '/run/xpra/USERNAME'</code>”, usually followed by <code>[Errno 13] Permission denied</code></h3>
<p>Harmless warning, safe to ignore. Or you can add your user to the <code>xpra</code> group.<br />
The server tries to create a socket in the shared group directory <code>/run/xpra</code>. This is only useful for sharing access to sessions via unix group membership, in combination with the <code>socket-permissions</code> option. ### <code>uinput</code> warnings: <code>uinput</code> is optional, all these warnings are safe to ignore: * “<code>Error: cannot query uinput device path</code>” or “<code>cannot access python uinput module: No module named uinput</code>” * “<code>cannot use uinput for virtual devices</code>” * “<code>cannot access python uinput module: name 'ABS_MAX' is not defined</code>” - your python-uinput package is broken, complain to your distributor * “<code>Failed to open the uinput device: Permission denied</code>” - you do not have the permissions required for opening the <code>/dev/uinput</code> device ### “<code>found an existing window manager on screen ...</code>” Xpra is a window manager, you cannot run two window managers on the same X11 display at the same time.<br />
If you want to forward a whole desktop, including its window manager, see <a href="./Usage/Start-Desktop.html">desktop mode</a>, otherwise stop the other window manager. ### “<code>cannot register our notification forwarder ...</code>” The xpra server was started from a GUI session which already had a dbus instance and a notification daemon, notifications forwarding cannot be enabled. ### “DPI set to NN x NN (wanted MM x MM), you may experience scaling problems, such as huge or small fonts, etc - to fix this issue, try the dpi switch, or use a patched Xorg dummy driver” The vfb command in use does not preserve DPI settings. You may want to switch to using a patched <a href="./Usage/Xdummy.html">Xdummy</a>. ### “<code>xpra [errno 2] no such file or directory</code>” when connecting via ssh. Xpra is not installed on the remote host. ### X11 keyboard warnings: <code>Unsupported high keycode XXX for name &lt;INNN&gt; ignored</code> These are harmless and unavoidable, see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1615700#c1">Bug 1615700 - warning shows up after run “Xvfb :99 &amp;”</a> * <code>gtk_window_add_accel_group: assertion 'GTK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed</code> - harmless and unavoidable on MacOS * <code>gui.py: Warning: invalid cast from 'GtkMenuBar?' to 'GtkWindow?'</code> - harmless and unavoidable on MacOS ### MacOS complains about “damaged application”</p>
