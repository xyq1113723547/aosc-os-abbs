<h1 id="desktop-mode">Desktop Mode</h1>
<p><em>desktop mode</em> as opposed to <a href="./Seamless.html">seamless mode</a> runs a full desktop session in a window instead of having each individual window forwarded separately.<br />
This feature requires X11 server support and is not available on MacOS or MS Windows servers.</p>
<p>The behaviour is more similar to VNC but with the added benefits of the xpra protocol: sound, printer forwarding, etc. (see <a href="../Features/index.html">features</a>)</p>
<p>You can also connect using VNC clients.<br />
To access an existing desktop session, use the <a href="./Shadow-Server.html">shadow server</a>- which is also available on MacOS and MS Windows.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To start a desktop session simply run:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>xpra start-desktop --start=xterm</code></pre>
<p>Then connect as usual from the client, or using a VNC client.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can start a session and connect in one command from the client using the ssh syntax:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>xpra start-desktop --start=xterm ssh://USER@HOST/</code></pre>
<h2 id="window-manager-or-desktop-environment">Window Manager or Desktop Environment</h2>
<p>In order to run a window manager or even a full desktop environment within this desktop session, simply replace the “xterm” example above with the command that starts the WM or DE of your choice, ie for “fluxbox”:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>xpra start-desktop --start=fluxbox</code></pre>
<p>When choosing a window manager, be aware that the more featureful ones also tend to use more bandwidth and will appear to run more slowly.</p>
<h2 id="desktop-size">Desktop Size</h2>
<p>By default the desktop size will start using a screen resolution of 1920x1080, this virtual screen can be resized at any point using regular X11 tools (ie: “xrandr”).</p>
<p>To change the initial desktop size:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>xpra start-desktop --resize-display=&quot;1024x768&quot; --start=fluxbox</code></pre>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>to get the session to terminate when you exit the window manager, use <code>--start-child</code> with <code>--exit-with-children</code></li>
<li>some desktop environments may show options to shutdown or reboot the system from their start menu, which may or may not be appropriate</li>
</ul>
