<h1 id="xpra-configuration">Xpra Configuration</h1>
<p>Most xpra features can be configured from the command line or through xpraâ€™s configuration files.</p>
<p>You can find some example configuration files here: <a href="https://xpra.org/conf/">sample /etc/xpra/ directory</a></p>
<p>The configuration files use the exact same format as the command line options, which is documented in the <a href="https://xpra.org/manual.html">manual page</a>, just without the <code>--</code> prefix.<br />
The manual is also shipped with all binary installations and should be easily accessible. (ie: <code>man xpra</code>)</p>
<p><em>(some more obscure features can be configured using environmentent variables)</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="configuration-files-location">Configuration Files Location</h3>
<p>The exact location of the configuration files varies widely from platform to platform, and even from one version of the OS to another. * for unix-like operating systems, the system configuration files can usually be found in <code>/etc/xpra</code> and the per-user settings can be placed in <code>~/.config/xpra</code> - you can also run the <code>xpra/platform/path.py</code> script for more details * on Mac OS X, we ship a command line tool found under <code>Xpra.app/Contents/Helpers/Path_info</code> which will show you the file locations, the default location for user configuration files should be <code>~/Library/Application Support/Xpra</code> you can also use - <code>~/.config/xpra</code>, although this is deprecated * on MS Windows, you can run the <code>Path_info.exe</code> tool found in the Xpra installation folder</p>
<hr />
<p>You should generally not edit the system default configuration files, as those may be overwritten whenever xpra is (re)installed. Use the per-user configuration files instead, or add your own configuration file.</p>
